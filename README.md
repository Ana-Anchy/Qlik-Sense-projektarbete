# Qlik-Sense-projektarbete

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains my Qlik Sense project (Course Project Work), where I developed a complete **business intelligence dashboard** for analyzing sales, customers, products, and geographical distribution.  

The project demonstrates how **data-driven decision-making** can be supported by interactive dashboards:  
- Provide **KPI metrics** for total sales, number of orders, and customers  
- Analyze **sales distribution per country** using geo-maps  
- Identify **top customers** and visualize their revenue contribution (Pareto 80/20)  
- Compare **sales performance over time** and between years  
- Break down **revenues, costs, and profit margins** per product category  
- Drill down to **transaction-level details** with pivot and detail sheets  

The solution combines **visual storytelling** with actionable insights for controllers, sales managers, and analysts.

## ðŸ›  Demonstrated Practical Skills  

- **Data modeling** â€“ Loading and joining QVD files (Orders, Customers, Products, Calendar, Employees)  
- **Set Analysis** â€“ Building advanced Qlik expressions (YTD vs LYTD, Pareto, AOV, Profit Margin)  
- **Variable management** â€“ Defining reusable variables for QVD paths and calculations  
- **Data visualization** â€“ Using bar charts, line charts, scatterplots, pie/donut charts, treemaps, and pivot tables  
- **Dashboard design** â€“ Creating user-friendly layouts with filters, KPIs, and drill-down options  
- **Trend analysis** â€“ Year-over-year sales comparison and accumulated Pareto share  
- **Controller perspective** â€“ Transaction-level detail view with costs, revenues, and margins

## ðŸ“Š Key Dashboards  

- **Dashboard** â€“ KPI overview (Sales, Orders, Customers) + sales by country and time  
- **Overview Sheet** â€“ Top customers and sales trends  
- **Analysis** â€“ Sales YoY comparison, Pareto by customer, margins by category  
- **Pivot** â€“ Multi-dimensional pivot table for deeper analysis  
- **Detail View** â€“ Transaction-level data for controller validation  
- **Information** â€“ Documentation of metrics, fields, and definitions

## ðŸ“Œ Reflections  

One of the main challenges was building correct expressions in **Qlik Set Analysis** to calculate key metrics like profit margin, accumulated Pareto share, and average order value. Another important aspect was designing the sheets in a way that is both **logical for users** and **visually appealing**.  

By creating different types of visualizations (line charts, bars, pie charts, scatterplots, treemaps, and pivot tables), the project demonstrates the **full breadth of Qlik Sense capabilities**.
